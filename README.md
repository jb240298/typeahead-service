# Typeahead-Sevice
Implemented a backend service to search a word in a Dictionary using Trie Data Structure to provide an autocomplete(typeahead) feature. Moreover, the service also comprises an implementation of an Edit Distance Algorithm, which is used to provide an appropiate suggession feature whenever there is a typo and the requested word does not exist in the Dictionary.
